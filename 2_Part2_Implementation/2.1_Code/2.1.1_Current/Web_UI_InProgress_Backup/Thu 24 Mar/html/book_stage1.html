													If you could unlock the full potential of your mind, what kind of wonders - and dangers - would await?
													<br />
													This is something that Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is about to discover. Eddie is a slacker, a former cocaine addict, and an author who has failed to write a single word of his novel. But when he is introduced to a mind-expanding drug, his brain starts to function at the full 100 per cent, enabling him to write his novel, learn new languages at lightspeed, and master the complexities of Wall Street. Of course, a man with these skills is going to draw attention from some powerful characters. Robert De Niro plays the marvelously named Carl Van Loon, a tyrannical businessman who wants to use Eddie for his own purposes, and will baulk at nothing to bend him to his will.
													<br />
													When such powerful forces are ranged against you, is great intelligence enough to save yourself and the ones you love?

													L.A. becomes the battleground for the final stand between aliens and humans in this explosive sci-fi film, starring Aaron Eckhart.
													<br />
													After decades of documented UFO sightings being written off as crackpot, alien invasion becomes a frightening reality in 2011 as earth is besieged by extra-terrestrial armies. As some of the world's greatest cities fall at the hands of these interlopers, L.A. is the last battleground standing. Now it's up to Marine staff sergeant Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart) and his platoon - including technical sergeant Elena Santos (Michelle Rodriguez) - to take on the enemy in action the likes of which they've never seen before. As men, women and children alike run for their lives, and cityscapes are destroyed in the blink of an eye, it's up to Nantz to mount an effective defense against earth's attackers, before L.A. succumbs, just as all the other cities have

													The IT Crowd's Richard Ayoade makes his feature film directorial debut with Submarine, an unconventional comedy about Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts), a 15-year-old boy with only two relatively simple yet all-consuming objectives. One, he's committed to losing his virginity before his next birthday, and two, he wants to prevent his mother (played by Sally Hawkins) from leaving his depressed father for a seductive mystic. He's almost there with the girlfriend, Jordana (Yasmin Paige), a girl he's seduced purely with his extensive vocabulary and his unerring self belief, but keeping his mum in check is going to require a greater degree of cunning... Showcasing the talents of newcomer Craig Roberts, with Richard Ayoade making his debut behind the camera, this is a film of fantastic firsts and is well worth a watch.
