Hi Dave

I thought when we last met (last Friday), I had mentioned I had interviews Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday (I have since managed to get more potential interviews next week (times not finalised) with apphaus on Monday, and rapid web on Wednesday, alongside my rejected Delcam (exam clash) one on Tuesday, and my Agilent on Thursday).

So. 11:30 will NOT be possible. :(
I feel like I am screwing the group around so much :(. Well. I am really.

My interview is from 10:30, and the next person's one is at 11, so I would assume I will probably be at Liverpool lime street station at close to 11pm. If I'm not in time for the 11:04 (Arrives @ Stafford @ 12:09) , then definitely the 11:34 (@ Stafford @ 12:49)

This means I will be free from 1-2 (If I get the earlier train, there's 30 minutes more), and as my only lecture isn't taking place (but we are expected to go there and work on the robot like normal regardless), I will be possible free for an additional chunk of 2-4.

Sorry for messing you around with time. Now, for the serious business of the work itself.

Other than peer assessment, and going through the hand in, what is left? Is there anything other than the sections in the final document which don't have content in them?

And as for the peer assessment. I realise, due to my lack of any form of actual submission you have to deduct a rather alarming percentage (Hopefully not all of it. I did contribute some things, however small!).
As much as I hate to admit it, I fully agree with the decision and reasoning. In fact, even if you had gone with fairly even markings anyway, I probably would have mentioned lowering me a bit, as I wouldn't feel like I deserve it.

However, I ask (incase you have the meeting at 11:30 anyway), to consider that I did do the assigned work both times (and an awful lot of code has gone into that webui+server), and that my problems came not from the doing the work itself (I.E: Not just not bothering to do the work), but instead from my utterly terrible (Word's cannot describe how bad) time management skills, which are practically non existent.

Finally, as for the non-use of the webui. I understand. :(
Would it be possible to copy it to the handin CD anyway, in an unused folder or something. So the work is shown as there, even if it isn't included in the actual product.

P.S 1.) I have copied this to dropbox so not to rely on just hotmail
P.S 2.) I'm going to continue developing the webui anyway, because it is awesome.
P.S 3.) I didn't ignore James's request for me to provide a screenshot. I took one.......... But it's been sitting around in ~/Pictures/Screenshots/Unsorted since then, which was rather silly of me. I have put this in the dropbox too.
P.S 4.) "2 days after the deadline (and an extension)". I thought Tuesday, before the group meeting, was the deadline for the webui? What is the extension referenced?. Also wasn't it 1 1/2 days?

Hi Scott,

Because you're at your interview, we're going to aim to do the final collaboration and hand in on Friday instead.
Please could you meet us at 11.30am in the octagon?

Regarding your web ui..

We've decided that it's just too late to do anything about it now.

You said that you sent us a partially working one on tuesday evening which we'd have been able to include in the testing document. But none of us ever got this email, and you ignored James's request to see a screen shot of that email as proof of you sending it.

Sorry, but a submission at 6am, 2 days after the deadline (and an extension) and the day after we scheduled to test the software (we know you had an interview, but you knew that we hadn't got anything from you on Tuesday, the day before we scheduled to test) is just too late.

We've all got assignments that we've put on the back burner for this project and we can't afford to spend more time than we already have done compensating for your non/late submissions.

Dave, James & Amanda
